# About 
(Project 8 out of 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp)

- Coded a Caesar Cipher using python
- User can either encode or decode what they desire

- TODO-1: Import and print the logo from art.py when the program starts.
- TODO-2: Code a safety net in case the user enters a shift that is greater than the number of letters in the alphabet
        #Try running the program and entering a shift number of 45.
        #Add some code so that the program continues to work even if the user enters a shift number greater than 26. 
        #Hint: Think about how you can use the modulus (%).    
-TODO-3: What happens if the user enters a number/symbol/space?
        #Fix the code to keep the number/symbol/space when the text is encoded/decoded
        #e.g. start_text = "meet me at 3"
        #end_text = "•••• •• •• 3"
- TODO-4: Figure out a way to ask the user if they want to restart the cipher program
        #e.g. Type 'yes' if you want to go again. Otherwise type 'no'.
        #If they type 'yes' then ask them for the direction/text/shift again and call the caesar() function again?
        #Hint: Try creating a while loop that continues to execute the program if the user types 'yes'.
